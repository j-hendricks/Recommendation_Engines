# Recommendation_Engines
In this project, I built movie-recommendation engines using content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. New skills I learned include: cosine similarity using Sci-kit Learn, building an algorithm for Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) from scratch, and building a user-item matrix for collaborative filtering.
